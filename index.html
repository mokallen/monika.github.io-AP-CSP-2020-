        	<p>My name is Mónika; Pronounced Mo-nee-ka. How often do I hear it correctly? If I'm being completely honest, maybe 1 time out of 10. But I actually find great pleasure in hearing the very interesting ways other people pronounce my name. Some of my top favorites of all time include: 'Mauna Kea', 'Monikia', and 'Mistake'. </p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
        	<p>While it may come as a surprise because of my "caucasian elocution", I'm actually born and (primarily) raised on the island of O'ahu. But, I have spent a lot of my life in Japan surrounded by the language and culture. I have a pretty extensive ethnic background, but I am for the most part Black (as you can tell...), Japanese, Korean, Native American, and White. I guess my 24/7 "phone voice" didn't come from just anywhere.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>

<h3>Mónika's Top 10 Epic Gamer Moments</h3>
            <p>I decided to leave the content portion open for the templates users to do as they wish with a blank canvas. I don't like to restrict my users too much, and for this reason I leave the defining of any content related styles to you.</p>

<h3>Be My Friend... Please</h3>   
            <p>While I believe myself to be quite the #catch, I suprisingly do not appeal to everyone. In fact, there are probably 5 people on this earth who are genuinley tolerant of my shenanigans. This does not include my family because I alienate myself in my room oops. So if I interest you for any reason at all, feel free to download and review a copy of my <a href="#">Friend Application</a>!</p>
