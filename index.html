        	<p>My name is MÃ³nika; Pronounced Mo-nee-ka. How often do I hear it correctly? If I'm being completely honest, maybe 1 time out of 10. But I actually find great pleasure in hearing the very interesting ways other people pronounce my name. Some of my top favorites of all time include: 'Mauna Kea', 'Monikia', and 'Mistake'. </p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
        	<p>While it may come as a surprise because of my "caucasian elocution", I'm actually born and (primarily) raised on the island of O'ahu. But, I have spent a lot of my life in Japan surrounded by the language and culture. I have a pretty extensive ethnic background, but I am for the most part Black (as you can tell...), Japanese, Korean, Native American, and White. I guess my 24/7 "phone voice" didn't come from just anywhere.
