        	<p>Hey! My name is MÃ³nika Allen; Pronounced Mo-nee-ka. How often do I hear it correctly? If I'm being completely honest, maybe 1 time out of 10. But I actually find great pleasure in hearing the ways other people mispronounce my name. Some of my top favorites of all time include: 'Mauna Kea', 'Monikia', and 'Mistake'. </p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
        	<p>Some basic info about me: I'm a Junior at James Campbell Highschool and my birthday is January 17th. I share my date of birth with many great people like Michelle Obama, Muhammad Ali, and Lil John. Aren't they lucky. While it may come as a surprise because of my "caucasian elocution", I'm actually born and (primarily) raised on the island of O'ahu. But, I have spent a lot of my life in Japan surrounded by the language and culture. I have a pretty extensive ethnic background, but I am for the most part African American (as you can tell... LOL), Japanese, Korean, and Native American. My coding experience is currently at ZERO and I am highly unqualified to be in this class. But, I hope to improve and one day make a new hobby or even career out of coding!

<h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
           	<p>Some of my hobbies include student council, track and field, drawing, anime, casual video games (Nintendo, The Sims, Otome Games and etc.), shopping, and video editing. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends. My favorite type of music is a mixture of R&B, Neo-Soul, Alternative Hip-Hop, and Disco. I love to eat fruits, hamburgers, and sushi. Cats are my favorite animal, and I follow (But don't genuinley believe in) astrological readings.</p>
